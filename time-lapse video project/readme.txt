this project use beagle-board xm and leopard imaging to make time-lapse video.

the capture code communicates between board and camera, also controls the camera to capture 1 frame per second or 10 frames per second. Transfer the raw YUV color mode to RGB mode.Then encode those frames into a time-lapse video.
